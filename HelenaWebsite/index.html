    <p>
      My research focuses on understanding what aspects of linguistic meaning
      are hard-coded as opposed to derived during linguistic interactions. To
      answer this question, I combines insights from theoretical linguistics,
      and cognitive science more broadly, with experimental and computational
      methods.
